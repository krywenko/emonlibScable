# emonlibScable
based on openenergy monitor  libary  it provides compatiblity to esp8266 and arduino that to become open energy monitor. it a little more configurable then emonlib  as it allows you to choose between mcp3008 analog pins and built in analog pins to esp and arduino uno.  scalable to  4  stackable shields  for a total of 32 CTs on esp and 36 cts on an uno it works in conjubction with the openenergy monitor emontx shield for arduino. it also has extra configuration to allow for balancing and error correcton of CTs
